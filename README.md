This is a simple application that allows users to search for repositories on GitHub and display them in a view controller.  Repositories displayed include the repository name, author, description, updated time stamp, and languages. Selecting a repository will open and display a web view of the repository. Users can login with Github and be authenticated with OAuth. 

Technical choices include using AFNetworking framework for requests.  AFNetworking is a powerful open source framework that allows for easy http requests and operation queues. The Github API (https://developer.github.com/v3/) allows apps to connect to Github and perform RESTful operations. Using the Github Api with AFNetworking allowed for more control over searching repositories, authenticating users, and put/get requests.  Architectural choices in this project include MVC structure.  It consist of my Repository class for a model, SearchViewController/LoginViewController being the controllers, and RepositoryCell being part of the view.
